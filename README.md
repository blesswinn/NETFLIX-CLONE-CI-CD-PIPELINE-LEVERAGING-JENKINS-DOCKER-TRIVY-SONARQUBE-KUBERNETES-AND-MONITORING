## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Hardware Requirements:
The system should be hosted on hardware with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage resources to support the deployment and execution of CI/CD pipelines and associated tools.
* Software Requirements:
The system should support operating systems compatible with the tools used in the CI/CD pipeline, such as Linux distributions for Docker and Kubernetes.
Compatible versions of Jenkins, Docker, Trivy, SonarQube, Kubernetes, and monitoring solutions should be installed and configured on the system.
* Network Requirements:
The system should have access to the internet to download updates, dependencies, and container images from external repositories and registries.
Proper network configuration should be in place to facilitate communication between different components of the CI/CD pipeline, including version control systems, build servers, and deployment targets.
* Security Requirements:
The system should adhere to security best practices to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
Access controls and permissions should be configured to restrict access to sensitive resources and functionalities within the CI/CD pipeline.
Security measures such as encryption, authentication, and authorization should be implemented to safeguard communication and data integrity.
* Compatibility Requirements:
The system should be compatible with the tools and technologies used in the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability between different components.
Compatibility with existing infrastructure and development environments should be considered to facilitate smooth adoption and integration of the CI/CD pipeline into the existing workflow.
* Performance Requirements:
The system should be capable of handling concurrent builds, tests, and deployments efficiently, without significant degradation in performance.
Performance metrics such as build times, deployment speed, and resource utilization should meet acceptable thresholds to ensure timely delivery of updates and responsiveness of the application.
* Reliability and Availability Requirements:
The system should be highly reliable and available, with minimal downtime and service disruptions.
Redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans should be in place to ensure continuity of operations in the event of hardware or software failures.
* Scalability Requirements:
The system should be scalable to accommodate increasing workloads and user demand, with provisions for horizontal and vertical scaling of resources.
Scalability should be achieved through efficient resource allocation, load balancing, and dynamic provisioning of infrastructure components.
